## Stack
ASP.NET Core Razor Pages · Minimal APIs (Program.cs) · EF Core + SQLite · Plain JS (no framework)

## Commands
```sh

dotnet test
```

## Architecture
UI → JS → Minimal API → EF Core → SQLite
Character Sheet = main integration point.

## Rules
- Reuse existing patterns. No new frameworks, no restructuring, no unnecessary renames.
- Business logic in C# only. JS is UI-only glue—never duplicate logic across layers.
- Inspect first, then propose a plan by file for non-trivial changes.
- After edits: build, summarize changed files, explain why.

## Security
Public-facing app. Protect all write endpoints. Validate all inputs. Secure cookie/auth defaults. No hardcoded secrets.

## Migration Rules (EF Core)
- Never modify existing migrations — always add new ones
- One migration per logical group (see order below)
- Run `dotnet ef database update` and verify after each migration before proceeding
- If a migration fails: `dotnet ef database update [PreviousMigrationName]` to roll back, then fix
- All new columns must be nullable or have a default value to avoid breaking existing rows
- Never store binary image data in the database — store file paths or URLs only

## Implementation Order (remaining features)
1. Stats (remaining of 30), Valuta, Pouch, Anteckningar — new columns on Character
2. HP / damage taken per body part — new columns on Character
3. Lärdomar + Evolutioner — new tables with FK to Character
4. Pets DB persistence — new Pets table with FK to Character, store icon path as string
5. Character image upload — disk storage now, designed for swappable IFileStorage later
6. Pet grid icons — store icon filename/path as string on Pet entity (no binary data)

## Image Storage Strategy
- Current: save uploaded images to wwwroot/uploads/ and store relative path in DB
- Future (hosted): swap to Azure Blob Storage or Cloudflare R2 by implementing IFileStorage
- Never base64-encode images into the database
- Pet/item icons: always stored as file path strings pointing to IconsPets/ or IconsItems/

## Architecture Reminders
- Minimal APIs only — no MVC controllers
- No Blazor, no React — vanilla JS + Razor Pages only
- All JS lives in wwwroot/js/ — modular files per feature
- EF Core + SQLite via app.db — swap to postgres when hosted if needed
- Icon discovery is folder-driven — adding icons requires no code changes
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
markdown- New pages get their own CSS and JS files in wwwroot/css/ and wwwroot/js/
- No npm, no bundlers, no build step — vanilla JS only, loaded via @section Scripts

## Äventyrsdagbok (Adventure Log)
Files: `Pages/Aventyrsdagbok/Index.cshtml`, `wwwroot/css/aventyrsdagbok.css`, `wwwroot/js/aventyrsdagbok.js`, `Data/Adventure.cs`, `Data/Chapter.cs`, `Data/ImageLink.cs`

**DB:** Three tables via `AdventureLog` migration. `Adventures.UserId` stores username string (not FK). Cascade delete configured explicitly in `OnModelCreating` for Chapter→Adventure and ImageLink→Chapter.

**API endpoints:**
GET/POST   /api/adventures
DELETE     /api/adventures/{id}          → deletes wwwroot/AdventureImages/{id}/
GET/POST   /api/adventures/{id}/chapters
PUT/DELETE /api/chapters/{id}            → DELETE also deletes physical image files
POST       /api/chapters/{id}/images     → multipart; returns { id, imagePath, fileName }
DELETE     /api/images/{id}              → also deletes physical file
All endpoints require auth and verify ownership via `chapter → adventure → user`.

**Autosave:** 10s debounce per chapter; resets on every keystroke in body/title; fires immediately on collapse/expand and adventure switch. Shows "Sparad ✓" on success.

**Image-linked words:** Stored as `<span class="img-link" data-src="..." data-image-id="..." data-filename="...">word</span>` inline in `BodyHtml`. `data-image-id` connects DOM spans to `ImageLink` rows for delete. Image URLs are real `/AdventureImages/...` paths — never `createObjectURL()` blobs.

**Critical conventions:**
- Always project EF entities to anonymous objects before returning from endpoints — navigation properties on both sides cause JSON object cycles (HTTP 500). Use `.Select(x => new { x.Id, … })` and omit nav props.
- Physical-file lifecycle must match DB lifecycle: deleting a parent entity must also delete its files on disk.
- During development: wrap new endpoints in `try/catch` returning `Results.Problem(ex.Message)` so 500s surface the actual error.

**contenteditable img-link caret bleeding:** After `range.insertNode(span)`, the browser keeps inserting typed text inside the span. Fix: insert a real space text node after the span and move the caret to position 1 inside it — `setStartAfter(span)` is unreliable. A `keydown` guard on each chapter editor must intercept Space, Enter, and Shift+Enter when `selection.anchorNode.parentElement?.closest('.img-link')` is non-null: `preventDefault`, insert a sibling text node after the span, move the caret there before the browser inserts the character. Note: `closest` must be called on `parentElement`, not the text node itself. Strip zero-width spaces from `editor.innerHTML` at every `ch.bodyHtml =` assignment site before persisting to state or DB.

## Character Sheet — Shared DOM Panel
- One `#panel-sheet` is reused for all character tabs. Every domain must be explicitly reset on tab switch — nothing clears itself.
- `VP.sheet.clear()` is the single orchestrator and must be fully self-contained. When new sub-modules are added to the sheet, add their clear-on-null call to the end of `clear()`.
- Sub-module null guard pattern: never `if (!characterId) return` — always clear state and re-render before returning. Applies to `loadPets()`, `skills.reload(null)`, and any future modules.
- `String(null) === "null"` is truthy — always use `characterId = newId ? String(newId) : null` when passing ids to sub-modules.
- Zeroing `state.itemsCache = []` does not clear the visual grid — must call `VP.grid.render.renderSlots(slotsGrid, itemsGrid, state, 0, 0)`.
- Tab manager Path 2 (return visit, `tab.fieldState` set) must call `VP.sheet.clear()` before `setFieldState` when `!tab.id`, otherwise skills and pets are never cleared on return to a blank tab.

## Data Model

### CharacterGroup
- `Id` (int, PK), `Name` (string, max 100), `SortOrder` (int, default 0)

### Character (additions)
- `GroupId` (int?, nullable FK → CharacterGroup) — null means Main / ungrouped
- Deleting a group nulls `GroupId` on its characters; characters are never cascade-deleted with a group

## API Endpoints (Character Groupings)
- `GET    /api/groups`                → list all groups ordered by SortOrder, then Id
- `POST   /api/groups`                → body `{ name }` → create new group
- `DELETE /api/groups/{id}`           → null out `GroupId` on member characters, then delete group
- `PUT    /api/characters/{id}/group` → body `{ groupId }` (nullable) → reassign character to group or Main
- The existing character list `GET` endpoint also returns `GroupId` per character

## Character List UI Patterns
- Page is section-based: Main (ungrouped, `GroupId == null`) renders first; custom groups follow ordered by SortOrder then Id
- Section headers reuse the existing brown section-banner style — do not introduce a new banner style
- Custom group headers have a delete button on the far right; Main has no delete button
- Each character row has a themed dropdown for moving the character between Main and custom groups; changes `PUT` immediately and the row moves in the DOM without a full reload
- Two stacked buttons at the top: "+ Ny karaktär" (existing) and "+ Ny gruppering" (darker variant)

## Conventions
- Group / character operations follow the established flow: UI event → `fetch()` → Minimal API → EF Core → SQLite → DOM update. No full page reloads.
- New themed UI controls derive from the existing gold button palette rather than introducing new colors.

## Tooling — Windows
- Do not pipe `dotnet` CLI commands through `2>&1` — can cause stdout-buffering hangs on Windows. Run dotnet commands plain.
